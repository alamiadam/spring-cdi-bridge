A simple bridge that allows the Spring 3.x framework to resolve scope annotations offered by the JSR-299. With this module a Spring bean can be declared in a 100% JavaEE compliant way, since Spring already support the JSR-330.

Now the Spring beans can be defined like:

...
@javax.inject.Named("mySpringBean")
@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped
public class MySpringBeanController
{

  // java code ...
  ...

}


Build the single JAR with:

mvn (clean) install

and use it inside your project like:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.wessendorf.spring.scopes</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-cdi-bridge</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
